abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) systems have become one of the most promising
  alternative energy sources, as they transform the sun’s energy into
  electricity. This can frequently be achieved without causing any potential
  harm to the environment. Although their usage in residential places and
  building sectors has notably increased, PV systems are regarded as
  unpredictable, changeable, and irregular power sources. This is because, in
  line with the system’s geographic region, the power output depends to a
  certain extent on the atmospheric environment, which can vary drastically.
  Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches are extensively
  employed to examine the effects of climate change on solar power. Then, the
  most optimal AI algorithm is used to predict the generated power. In this
  study, we used machine learning (ML)-based algorithms to predict the generated
  power of a PV system for residential buildings. Using a PV system,
  Pyranometers, and weather station data amassed from a station at King Khalid
  University, Abha (Saudi Arabia) with a residential setting, we conducted
  several experiments to evaluate the predictability of various well-known ML
  algorithms from the generated power. A backward feature-elimination technique
  was applied to find the most relevant set of features. Among all the ML
  prediction models used in the work, the deep-learning-based model provided the
  minimum errors with the minimum set of features (approximately seven
  features). When the feature set is greater than ten features, the polynomial
  regression model shows the best prediction, with minimal errors. Comparing all
  the prediction models, the highest errors were associated with the linear
  regression model. In general, it was observed that with a small number of
  features, the prediction models could minimize the generated power
  prediction’s mean squared error value to approximately 0.15.
